    <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
    <p>
      The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
      youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
      coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
      detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
      technical hockey background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
    </p>

            given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should
            be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.

          <p>
            Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100
            x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in the
            state competition program that are unable to provide a field that
            meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition
            Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field
            and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
            dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
            associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
            required to play all their games away.
